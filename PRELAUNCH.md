# Prelaunch Hopefulls

This is my plan of things I'd like to complete before I launch this.

Stage 1 - setup, make sure that this works for my email system

Stage 2 - get working as a django app, no js (or not much)
    
            - receive new messages
            - view individual messages
            - (maybe) send messages 

Stage 3 - all js.

            vue it up
